  <h1>Regina Briseño</h1>
  <div class="subtitle">Economist · Researcher</div>

  <p>
    I am an economist with research interests in inflation dynamics and applied microeconometrics.
    My work focuses on price-setting behavior, cost pass-through, and the role of sectoral linkages
    in shaping inflation outcomes.
  </p>

  <p>
    I hold a B.A. in Economics from ITAM. I have worked as an economist at the Directorate General
    of Economic Research at Banco de México. I am preparing to apply to PhD programs in Economics.
  </p>

  <h2>Research</h2>

  <h3>Working Paper</h3>

  <div class="paper">
    <strong>Inflation Volatility across Advanced and Emerging Economies during the COVID-19 Pandemic</strong><br>
    <span class="authors">with L. Arango-Castillo and M. J. Orraca</span><br>
    Banco de México Working Paper No. 2025-13<br>
    <p>
      This paper studies the relationship between inflation levels and inflation volatility during
      the COVID-19 period using data from over sixty economies. Using GARCH-based specifications,
      we show that inflation volatility is strongly associated with commodity price shocks and
      periods of heightened global uncertainty.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3>Works in Progress</h3>

  <div class="paper">
    <strong>Industry-Specific Cost Indices to Monitor Pressures on Inflation</strong><br>
    <span class="authors">with A. Espinoza, V. López, and M. J. Orraca</span>
    <p>
      This project constructs industry-level cost indices using input–output tables to disentangle
      the sources of inflationary pressures in Mexico. The indices are designed to separate
      cost-driven pressures from demand-driven dynamics and to improve monitoring of inflation risks.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="paper">
    <strong>Producer Price Index Inflation Variance Transmission within Manufacturing Sectors</strong><br>
    <span class="authors">with L. Arango-Castillo and M. J. Orraca</span>
    <p>
      This project studies the transmission of PPI inflation variance across manufacturing sectors
      in Mexico, the United States, and Canada, focusing on cross-sectoral and cross-country spillovers
      arising from input–output linkages and regional production networks.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h3>Undergraduate Thesis</h3>

  <div class="paper">
    <strong>Asymmetric Pass-Through and Competition in Isolated Mexican Gasoline Markets</strong><br>
    Undergraduate thesis, ITAM
    <p>
      This thesis examines retail gasoline pricing in Mexico following market deregulation. I
      construct a novel measure of local competition in geographically isolated markets and document
      asymmetric cost pass-through, with stronger price responses to cost increases than to decreases.
